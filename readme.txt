3. FEATURES
   ========
TeemIp 3.2.2 supports all the new features brought by iTop 3.2.2 and has been adapted to it.
iTop new featured are documented at https://www.itophub.io/wiki/page?id=3_2_0:release:whats_new

Localization
------------
TeemIp is available in Chinese (simplified), English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian) and Spanish!

Because TeemIp relies on iTop and because iTop is available in 15 different languages, TeemIp could be available within
the same languages at a translation cost that is not too high. Indeed, around 4000 entries that are specific to
TeemIp modules need to be translated. Should you volunteer to translate TeemIp modules or correct and complete existing
dictionaries, just create and submit pull requests on github. You may as well contact xtophe38@users.sourceforge.net to
discuss about your translation project.
