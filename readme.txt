Localization
------------
TeemIp is available in Chinese, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish !

Because TeemIp relies on iTop and because iTop is available in 15 different languages, TeemIp could be available within
the same languages at a translation cost that is not too high. Indeed, around 3500 entries that are specific to
TeemIp modules need to be translated. Should you volunteer to translate TeemIp modules, please, contact 
xtophe38@users.sourceforge.net. I'll provide you with the files that need translation.

Known limitations & issues
